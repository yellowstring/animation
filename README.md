This is a short flipbook style animation of a guy falling onto the ground in a flipbook style.

This is part of something I'm doing, to write small bits and pieces of code every day to get the syntax in my head. I'm also still getting used to all of git and stuff, so forgive me if i make a very terrible repository.
